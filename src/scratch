adjacency
vertex list graph for all vertex traversal
depth first traversal with no repetitions possible?
nonmutable n.g. must discover deepest ranked node before pruning
  resolve repetitions during construction
  leave i,j nondense on repetition, but gather empty intervals during construction and iterate all vertices to resolve (canonical ordering guarantee on monotonic vertex list).
mutable property graph to admit i,j\'s
dfs order naturally has monotonic nondecreasing j property
